 * Created by Icebreakers on 3/5/17.
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
 of repeated characters.
 For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3.
 If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original
 string, your method should return the original string.
